But will he save the circulation? Thumping. Thumping.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.

Thumping. Thump. This morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a man to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. His machineries are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand: fermenting. Working away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing to get in.</span></p><span id="page3"></span><p class="p_style0"><span class="style0">HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style1">Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman's spare body, admiring a glossy crown.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth. It's the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in the official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in the year one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis, barony of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute showing return of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina. Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake's weekly Pat and Bull story. Uncle Toby's page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin's queries. Dear Mr Editor, what is a good cure for flatulence? I'd like that part. Learn a lot teaching others. The personal note. M. A. P. Mainly all pictures. Shapely bathers on golden strand. World's biggest balloon. Double marriage of sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at each other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than the Irish.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style1">The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they'd clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle the whole thing. Want a cool head.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style1">Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">Mr Bloom stood in his way.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Did you? Hynes asked.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you'll catch him.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I'll tap him too.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">He hurried on eagerly towards the</span><span class="style1"> </span><span class="style3"> Freeman's Journal</span><span class="style1">.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">Three bob I lent him in Meagher's. Three weeks.

This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">The foreman moved his pencil towards it.</span></p><span id="page4"></span><p class="p_style0"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants two keys at the top.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style1">Hell of a racket they make. He doesn't hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves. Maybe he understands what I.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">Let him take that in first.</span></p><p class="p_style8"><span class="style1">Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman's sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles of it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.</span></p><p class="p_style8"><span class="style1">Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.</span></p><p class="p_style8"><span class="style0">HOUSE OF KEY(E)S</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name. Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">Better not teach him his own business.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that's a good idea?</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.</span></p><p class="p_style7"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor, the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that</span><span class="style1"> </span><span class="style3"> voglio.</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style1"> But then if he didn't know only make it awkward for him. Better not.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a house there too. I'll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style1">The foreman thought for an instant.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months' renewal.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it silently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">ORTHOGRAPHICAL</span></p><span id="page5"></span><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">Want to be sure of his spelling.

It is amusing to view the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess</span> <span class="style1">ment of a harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pear under a cemetery wall. Silly, isn't it? Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">I should have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I ought to have said something about an old hat or something. No. I could have said. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style1">Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost human the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak. That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in its own way. Sllt.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style0">NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style1">The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Wait. Where's the archbishop's letter? It's to be repeated in the</span><span class="style1"> </span><span class="style3"> Telegraph.</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style1"> Where's what's his name?</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style1">He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Ay. Where's Monks?</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Monks!</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style1">Mr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Then I'll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you'll give it a good place I know.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Monks!</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Yes, sir.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">Three months' renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Try it anyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge. Tourists over for the show.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style0">A DAYFATHER</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled, aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs' ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I'd say. Wife a good cook and washer. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn nonsense. AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type. Reads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practice that. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, O dear! All that long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage</span><span class="style1"> </span><span class="style3"> Alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu</span><span class="style1">. No, that's the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob's sons. And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well. Justice it means but it's everybody eating everyone else. That's what life is after all. How quickly he does that job. Practice makes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.</span></p><span id="page6"></span><p class="p_style9"><span class="style1">Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as Citron's house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.</span></p><p class="p_style9"><span class="style0">ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style1">He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy smell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom's next door when I was there.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap I put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something I forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">A sudden screech of laughter came from the</span><span class="style1"> </span><span class="style3"> Evening Telegraph</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style1"> office.

How's that for high?</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style3">The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage</span><span class="style1">.

I don't want to hear any more of the stuff.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.</span></p><span id="page7"></span><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see. Rather upsets a man's day, a funeral does. He has influence they say. Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death written this long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first himself. Johnny, make room for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges Eyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on gale days. Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">What is it? Mr Bloom asked.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone.</span><span class="style1"> </span><span class="style3"> Our lovely land</span><span class="style1">.

Is he taking anything for it?</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style4">—</span><span class="style3">As 'twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland's portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight...</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style0">HIS NATIVE DORIC</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style4">—</span><span class="style3">That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence...</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and onions! That'll do, Ned. Life is too short.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style1">He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.</span></p><p class="p_style11"><span class="style1">Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh's unshaven blackspectacled face.</span></p><p class="p_style11"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Doughy Daw! he cried.</span></p><p class="p_style11"><span class="style0">WHAT WETHERUP SAID</span></p><p class="p_style3"><span class="style1">All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn't he? Why they call him Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely. Entertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said that. Get a grip of them by the stomach.</span></p><span id="page9"></span><p class="p_style12"><span class="style1">The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked:</span></p><p class="p_style12"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">What is it?</span></p><p class="p_style12"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.</span></p><p class="p_style12"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.</span></p><p class="p_style12"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink after that.</span></p><p class="p_style12"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.</span></p><p class="p_style12"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style1">Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor's blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom's face, shadowed by a smile.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style0">MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">In Ohio! the editor shouted.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style1">Passing out he whispered to J. J. O'Molloy:</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Incipient jigs. Sad case.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face. My Ohio!</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style0">O, HARP EOLIAN!</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Bingbang, bangbang.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">He went in.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.</span></p><span id="page10"></span><p class="p_style0"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">That'll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret. Hello, Jack. That's all right.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Good day, Myles, J. J. O'Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">The telephone whirred inside.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Twentyeight... No, twenty... Double four... Yes.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style0">SPOT THE WINNER</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">Lenehan came out of the inner office with SPORT'S tissues.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O. Madden up.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">He tossed the tissues on to the table.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style1">Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">It wasn't me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There's a hurricane blowing.</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style1">Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style1">He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Him, sir.</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style1">He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style1">J. J. O'Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Continued on page six, column four.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Yes,</span><span class="style1"> </span><span class="style3"> Evening Telegraph</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style1"> here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.

I'll catch him.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style0">A COLLISION ENSUES</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style1">The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style3">Pardon, monsieur</span><span class="style1">, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.</span></p><span id="page11"></span><p class="p_style0"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I'm in a hurry.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Knee, Lenehan said.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style1">He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">The accumulation of the</span><span class="style1"> </span><span class="style3"> anno Domini</span><span class="style1">.</span></p><p class="p_style0"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Sorry, Mr Bloom said.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style1">He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O'Molloy slapped the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:</span></p><p class="p_style14"><span class="style4">—</span><span class="style3">We are the boys of Wexford</span></p><p class="p_style15"><span class="style3">Who fought with heart and hand.</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style0">EXIT BLOOM</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">I'm just running round to Bachelor's walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes's. Want to fix it up. They tell me he's round there in Dillon's.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style1">He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Begone! he said. The world is before you.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style1">J. J. O'Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan's hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">He'll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps after him.</span></p><p class="p_style10"><span class="style2">—</span><span class="style1">Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.</span></p></div></body></html>
