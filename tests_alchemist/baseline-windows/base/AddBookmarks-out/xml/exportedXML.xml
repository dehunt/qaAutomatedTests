Long John is backing him, they say.</span></p><p><span>The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.

He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants two keys at the top.</span></p><p><span>Hell of a racket they make. He doesn't hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves. Maybe he understands what I.</span></p><p><span>The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.</span></p><p><span>—</span><span>Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.</span></p><p><span>Let him take that in first.</span></p><p><span>Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman's sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.

O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.</span></p><p><span>Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.</span></p><p><span style="bold">HOUSE OF KEY(E)S</span></p><p><span>—</span><span>Like that, see.

You see? Do you think that's a good idea?</span></p><p><span>The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.</span></p><p><span>—</span><span>The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor, the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?</span></p><p><span>I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that</span><span style="italic"> voglio.</span><span> But then if he didn't know only make it awkward for him. Better not.</span></p><p><span>—</span><span>We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?</span></p><p><span>—</span><span>I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a house there too. I'll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.</span></p><p><span>The foreman thought for an instant.</span></p><p><span>—</span><span>We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months' renewal.</span></p><p><span>A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it silently.

Where's the archbishop's letter? It's to be repeated in the</span><span style="italic"> Telegraph.</span><span> Where's what's his name?</span></p><p><span>He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.</span></p><p><span>—</span><span>Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.</span></p><p><span>—</span><span>Ay.

Tourists over for the show.</span></p><p><span style="bold">A DAYFATHER</span></p><p><span>He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled, aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs' ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I'd say. Wife a good cook and washer. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn nonsense. AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER</span></p><p><span>He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type. Reads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practice that. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, O dear!

No, that's the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob's sons. And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well. Justice it means but it's everybody eating everyone else. That's what life is after all. How quickly he does that job. Practice makes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.</span></p><anchors id="page6"></anchors><p><span>Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as Citron's house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.</span></p><p><span style="bold">ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP</span></p><p><span>He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy smell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom's next door when I was there.</span></p><p><span>He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap I put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.</span></p><p><span>What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something I forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.</span></p><p><span>A sudden screech of laughter came from the</span><span style="italic"> Evening Telegraph</span><span> office. Know who that is. What's up? Pop in a minute to phone.
