As disclosed in the Company’s annual report published on 6 July 2011, YAPE accounted for about 6.8% of the Group’s turnover and 4.5% of the Group’s gross profit for year ended 31 March 2011. The adjusted net asset value of YAPE (adding back the amount of HK$3 million advanced by the Group) as at 31 March 2011 amounted to about RMB1.3 million (equivalent to approximately HK$1.6 million). For the two years ended 31 March 2010 and 2011, the net losses before taxation and extraordinary items attributable to YAPE amounted to RMB2.2 million and RMB1.5 million, and the net losses after taxation and extraordinary items attributable to YAPE amounted to RMB2.4 million and RMB1.5 million, respectively.</span></p><p><span>Since the Group’s acquisition of Fanhe (Beijing) Water Investment Co., Ltd. in April 2010 (as disclosed in the Company’s announcement dated 12 April 2010), the Group has begun to diversify its business into environmental protection and sewage treatment. Following the Group’s acquisition of certain patents in respect of water purification technology and formation of</span><span> 北京首 强創新環保有限公司</span><span> (Beijing Shuoqiang Innovative Environmental Protection Co., Ltd.*), a wholly foreign owned enterprise operating under the Group’s jointly-controlled entity (as disclosed in the Company’s announcement dated 11 August 2011), it is expected that the significance of the sector of environmental protection and sewage treatment to the Group’s entire business would increase, while the influence of business arising from trading of vehicles, machinery and equipment would decrease.</span></p><p><span>In view of the above, the Directors believe the disposal of YAPE would enable the Group to free up resources (in particular, management as well as financial resources) and focus on its emerging business of environmental protection and sewage treatment. Accordingly, the Directors (including all the independent non-executive Directors) consider that the disposal of YAPE is beneficial to the Company and its shareholders as a whole.</span></p><p><span>The Directors (including the independent non-executive Directors) also consider that the terms of the Disposal Agreement and the Debt Settlement Agreement and the aggregate consideration are fair and reasonable and are in the interest of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.</span></p><p><span>YAPE made operating losses (before taxation and extraordinary items) of about RMB2.2 million and RMB1.5 million,for year ended 31 March 2010 and 2011, respectively, and it is expected that it would continue to make a loss in the current financial year if YAPE were to remain in the Group.
