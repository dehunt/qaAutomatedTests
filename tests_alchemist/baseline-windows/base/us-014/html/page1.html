The presence of dual accountability systems was noted during the</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> IASA</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> era (Goertz and Duffy, 2001; O’Day, 1999), when many states had a system that applied to all schools as well as a Title I system charting the AYP of schools that received Title I funds.</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> was intended to reconcile these systems, and states have worked to integrate state accountability practices with new federal requirements.</span></p><p class="p_style2"><span class="style5">By 2006–07, a total of 27 states had accountability requirements that went beyond, or were used in addition to, what is required of these states under</span><span class="style5"> </span><span class="style6"> NCLB</span><span class="style5">.</span></p><p class="p_style3"><span class="style3">By 2006–07, three states phased our their pre-</span><span class="style4">NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> systems, and six states had added new accountability provisions in addition to what is required under</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style3">. One other state reported plans to implement an accountability system beyond</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> in 2007–08. States that developed systems since the passage of</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> indicated that they were building on the</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> requirements to make more coherent statewide systems that incorporated local priorities. One official, whose state is considering adding accountability requirements beyond</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> explained,</span></p><p class="p_style4"><span class="style3">“We are investigating having a state accountability piece to coexist with AYP but we don’t have it in place right now.… [W]e’re interested in including all of our assessments like our writing, our science, a few other things in an accountability system that are not a part of AYP.… We have five subject areas that students are required to pass to get a diploma. We would like somehow to include that, the students passing all five in the accountability some way. So… there are assessment data and other things that we think are important to include in an accountability system that</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> does not include.”</span></p><p class="p_style3"><span class="style3">In 2006–07, all state accountability programs that went beyond</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> used designations of school performance that differed somewhat from those of</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> or reported their results in different ways. For example, some used letter grades, others identified “high-improving” schools, and so forth. Another notable difference was that many state programs (15) relied on growth measures to track progress toward accountability targets instead of an absolute target (percent reaching a set proficiency level) as in</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style3">. As one state official explained, his state system was designed to hold schools accountable for the performance of students below proficiency, as well as above, “It’s not good enough to just have students meet the standard. For those students who are meeting the standards, [we want to know] what are schools doing to help them be performance level four or five years in the future. And then for students who are below the bar, what are schools doing? AYP focuses so much on students below the bar that we wanted to make sure that we were not losing and not forcing schools to not pay attention to those other students.”</span></p><p class="p_style1"><span class="style3">Fourteen states used different (or additional) measures of student achievement in their state accountability system (for example, tests in subjects not required under</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style3">), and two had different inclusion rules for LEP students. As a result of these alternate measures, 15 states that maintain their pre-</span><span class="style4">NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> accountability programs reported that different schools were identified for improvement under</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> than those identified under the state’s other initiative. Of the six states with post-</span><span class="style4">NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> accountability systems, four states identified different schools for improvement under the state system than under</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style3">.</span></p><span id="page2"></span><p class="p_style3"><span class="style3">Earlier in the implementation of</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style3">, observers reported tensions between the prior state accountability systems and the newer, less familiar</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> accountability requirements, particularly with respect to the identification of low-performing schools based on AYP. For example, in some cases, state accountability designations from spring 2003 testing differed from AYP determinations for the same schools. Reportedly, some schools that did not make AYP targets received high marks under the state system (Hoff, 2004).</span><span class="style7">47</span></p><p class="p_style5"><span class="style6">NCLB</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style5"> and other state or district accountability initiatives did not commonly generate conflicting designations of high- and low-performing schools, according to principal reports for 2004–05.</span></p><p class="p_style6"><span class="style3">In 2006–07, such discrepancies appeared limited. For example, only 2 percent of schools that were identified for improvement under</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> were identified as high-performing under a state or district accountability system. Conversely, only 3 percent of schools that were not identified by the</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> system received a separate state designation as low-performing (see Exhibit 19).</span></p><table class="bordered"><colgroup><col style="width:323px;" /><col style="width:154px;" /><col style="width:147px;" /></colgroup><tr><td colspan="3"><p class="p_style7"><span class="style1">Exhibit 19</span></p><p class="p_style8"><span class="style1">Percentage of Schools Identified and Not Identified for Improvement Under</span><span class="style1"> </span><span class="style8"> NCLB</span><span class="style1">, by</span></p><p class="p_style9"><span class="style1">Accountability Designations Under State or District Accountability Initiatives, 2006–07</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="p_style10"><span class="style9">Designation Under State or District Accountability Initiative</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style11"><span class="style9">Schools Identified</span></p><p class="p_style12"><span class="style9">Under</span><span class="style9"> </span><span class="style10"> NCLB</span></p><p class="p_style13"><span class="style11">(</span><span class="style12">n =</span><span class="style12"> </span><span class="style11"> 469)</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style14"><span class="style9">Schools Not Identified</span></p><p class="p_style15"><span class="style9">Under</span><span class="style9"> </span><span class="style10"> NCLB</span></p><p class="p_style16"><span class="style11">(</span><span class="style12">n =</span><span class="style12"> </span><span class="style11"> 918)</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="p_style10"><span class="style11">Low-performing</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style17"><span class="style11">34%</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style18"><span class="style11">3%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="p_style10"><span class="style11">No special designation</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style19"><span class="style11">11%</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style20"><span class="style11">33%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="p_style10"><span class="style11">High-performing</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style21"><span class="style11">2%</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style22"><span class="style11">18%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="p_style10"><span class="style11">Other/not sure</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style17"><span class="style11">14%</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style23"><span class="style11">9%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="p_style10"><span class="style11">No other system (other than</span><span class="style11"> </span><span class="style12"> NCLB</span><span class="style11">)</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style24"><span class="style11">39%</span></p></td><td><p class="p_style20"><span class="style11">37%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p class="p_style25"><span class="style13">Exhibit reads:</span><span class="style14"> </span><span class="style15"> Thirty-four percent of schools identified for improvement under</span><span class="style16"> </span><span class="style17"> NCLB</span><span class="style18"> </span><span class="style15"> were also</span><span class="style16"> </span><span class="style16"> designated as low-performing under a state or district accountability system.</span></p><p class="p_style25"><span class="style19">Note: Analysis includes principal survey respondents in jurisdictions that had a state or district accountability initiative in 2006–07.</span></p><p class="p_style25"><span class="style19">Source: NLS-</span><span class="style20">NCLB</span><span class="style19">, Principal Surveys.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="p_style26"><span class="style21">47</span><span class="style21"> </span><span class="style19"> See Linn (2005) for a more extensive discussion of differences between pre-</span><span class="style20">NCLB</span><span class="style20"> </span><span class="style19"> state accountability provisions and</span><span class="style19"> </span><span class="style20"> NCLB</span><span class="style20"> </span><span class="style19"> requirements.</span></p><span id="page3"></span><p class="p_style27"><span class="style5">Overall, most respondents reported success in incorporating</span><span class="style5"> </span><span class="style6"> NCLB</span><span class="style6"> </span><span class="style5"> requirements into state systems, but over one-third of district officials and principals believed that this additional system resulted in staff confusion about targets.</span></p><p class="p_style28"><span class="style3">In 2006–07, a majority of both district administrators and principals agreed that having a state or district program in addition to</span><span class="style3"> </span><span class="style4"> NCLB</span><span class="style4"> </span><span class="style3"> gives a more complete picture of effectiveness.
