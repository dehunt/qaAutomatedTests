The presence of dual accountability systems was noted during the</span><span style="italic"> IASA</span><span> era (Goertz and Duffy, 2001; O’Day, 1999), when many states had a system that applied to all schools as well as a Title I system charting the AYP of schools that received Title I funds.</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> was intended to reconcile these systems, and states have worked to integrate state accountability practices with new federal requirements.</span></p><p><span style="bold">By 2006–07, a total of 27 states had accountability requirements that went beyond, or were used in addition to, what is required of these states under</span><span style="bold"> NCLB</span><span style="bold">.</span></p><p><span>By 2006–07, three states phased our their pre-</span><span style="italic">NCLB</span><span> systems, and six states had added new accountability provisions in addition to what is required under</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span>. One other state reported plans to implement an accountability system beyond</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> in 2007–08. States that developed systems since the passage of</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> indicated that they were building on the</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> requirements to make more coherent statewide systems that incorporated local priorities. One official, whose state is considering adding accountability requirements beyond</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> explained,</span></p><p><span>“We are investigating having a state accountability piece to coexist with AYP but we don’t have it in place right now.… [W]e’re interested in including all of our assessments like our writing, our science, a few other things in an accountability system that are not a part of AYP.… We have five subject areas that students are required to pass to get a diploma. We would like somehow to include that, the students passing all five in the accountability some way. So… there are assessment data and other things that we think are important to include in an accountability system that</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> does not include.”</span></p><p><span>In 2006–07, all state accountability programs that went beyond</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> used designations of school performance that differed somewhat from those of</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> or reported their results in different ways. For example, some used letter grades, others identified “high-improving” schools, and so forth. Another notable difference was that many state programs (15) relied on growth measures to track progress toward accountability targets instead of an absolute target (percent reaching a set proficiency level) as in</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span>. As one state official explained, his state system was designed to hold schools accountable for the performance of students below proficiency, as well as above, “It’s not good enough to just have students meet the standard. For those students who are meeting the standards, [we want to know] what are schools doing to help them be performance level four or five years in the future. And then for students who are below the bar, what are schools doing? AYP focuses so much on students below the bar that we wanted to make sure that we were not losing and not forcing schools to not pay attention to those other students.”</span></p><p><span>Fourteen states used different (or additional) measures of student achievement in their state accountability system (for example, tests in subjects not required under</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span>), and two had different inclusion rules for LEP students. As a result of these alternate measures, 15 states that maintain their pre-</span><span style="italic">NCLB</span><span> accountability programs reported that different schools were identified for improvement under</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> than those identified under the state’s other initiative. Of the six states with post-</span><span style="italic">NCLB</span><span> accountability systems, four states identified different schools for improvement under the state system than under</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span>.</span></p><anchors id="page2"></anchors><p><span>Earlier in the implementation of</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span>, observers reported tensions between the prior state accountability systems and the newer, less familiar</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> accountability requirements, particularly with respect to the identification of low-performing schools based on AYP. For example, in some cases, state accountability designations from spring 2003 testing differed from AYP determinations for the same schools. Reportedly, some schools that did not make AYP targets received high marks under the state system (Hoff, 2004).</span><span>47</span></p><p><span style="bold">NCLB</span><span style="bold"> and other state or district accountability initiatives did not commonly generate conflicting designations of high- and low-performing schools, according to principal reports for 2004–05.</span></p><p><span>In 2006–07, such discrepancies appeared limited. For example, only 2 percent of schools that were identified for improvement under</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> were identified as high-performing under a state or district accountability system. Conversely, only 3 percent of schools that were not identified by the</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> system received a separate state designation as low-performing (see Exhibit 19).</span></p><table columns="3" rows="8"><row><cell col_span="3"><p><span style="bold">Exhibit 19</span></p><p><span style="bold">Percentage of Schools Identified and Not Identified for Improvement Under</span><span style="bold"> NCLB</span><span style="bold">, by</span></p><p><span style="bold">Accountability Designations Under State or District Accountability Initiatives, 2006–07</span></p></cell></row><row><cell><p><span style="bold">Designation Under State or District Accountability Initiative</span></p></cell><cell><p><span style="bold">Schools Identified</span></p><p><span style="bold">Under</span><span style="bold"> NCLB</span></p><p><span>(</span><span>n =</span><span> 469)</span></p></cell><cell><p><span style="bold">Schools Not Identified</span></p><p><span style="bold">Under</span><span style="bold"> NCLB</span></p><p><span>(</span><span>n =</span><span> 918)</span></p></cell></row><row><cell><p><span>Low-performing</span></p></cell><cell><p><span>34%</span></p></cell><cell><p><span>3%</span></p></cell></row><row><cell><p><span>No special designation</span></p></cell><cell><p><span>11%</span></p></cell><cell><p><span>33%</span></p></cell></row><row><cell><p><span>High-performing</span></p></cell><cell><p><span>2%</span></p></cell><cell><p><span>18%</span></p></cell></row><row><cell><p><span>Other/not sure</span></p></cell><cell><p><span>14%</span></p></cell><cell><p><span>9%</span></p></cell></row><row><cell><p><span>No other system (other than</span><span> NCLB</span><span>)</span></p></cell><cell><p><span>39%</span></p></cell><cell><p><span>37%</span></p></cell></row><row><cell col_span="3"><p><span style="bold">Exhibit reads:</span><span> Thirty-four percent of schools identified for improvement under</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> were also</span><span> designated as low-performing under a state or district accountability system.</span></p><p><span>Note: Analysis includes principal survey respondents in jurisdictions that had a state or district accountability initiative in 2006–07.</span></p><p><span>Source: NLS-</span><span style="italic">NCLB</span><span>, Principal Surveys.</span></p></cell></row></table><p><span>47</span><span> See Linn (2005) for a more extensive discussion of differences between pre-</span><span style="italic">NCLB</span><span> state accountability provisions and</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> requirements.</span></p><anchors id="page3"></anchors><p><span style="bold">Overall, most respondents reported success in incorporating</span><span style="bold"> NCLB</span><span style="bold"> requirements into state systems, but over one-third of district officials and principals believed that this additional system resulted in staff confusion about targets.</span></p><p><span>In 2006–07, a majority of both district administrators and principals agreed that having a state or district program in addition to</span><span style="italic"> NCLB</span><span> gives a more complete picture of effectiveness.
