The plan lays out the key challenges that will be addressed in the open government space. At the same time,</span><span> The Obama Administration’s Commitment to Open Government: A Status Report</span><span>, was released, which outlines the Administration’s major Open Government initiatives, summarizes the progress made on those initiatives, and explains how the Administration will continue to implement them over the next months and years.</span></p><p><span>GSA’s excellent work is highlighted with Data.gov, Challenge.gov</span><span>,</span><span> and other OCSIT initiatives as key components. GSA will keep openness as an operational standard. Details on how GSA will implement its Open Government Plan and flagship initiatives are available via the Open Government Dashboard published on the agency's Open Government web page:</span><span style="underline"><a href="http://GSA.gov/Open"> http://GSA.gov/Open</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span style="bold">Data.gov</span></p><p><span>We are the executive lead and project manager for</span><span style="underline"> Data.gov</span><span>, which is the flagship initiative of the Administration’s Open Government Directive.

We continue to provide value to the public through an enhanced delivery channel, and deployment of a shared data set hosting environment. Data.gov empowers the public by fundamentally changing the way government shares its data, and creates value through applications for daily use.

These active communities provide citizens with a place to find data on their topics of interest, access apps and tools that bring that data to life, read blogs from contributors from agencies like HHS and the Department of Energy, and use discussion forums.</span></p><p><span>Communities are able to aggregate content, collaboration capabilities, and data across agencies. With 6 communities today, including energy, health, law and 4 more expected in the next few months, this yields a potential savings of 5.5M.</span></p></li><li><p><span></span><span> Since the United States launched this capability, seven other national governments have launched their versions – and more are expected. India and the United States are working on</span><span style="bold"> Data.gov-in-a-Box</span><span>. This initiative seeks to help interested countries promote transparency, improve citizens’ engagement, and strengthen public service delivery by increasing citizens’ access to public information. For the Data.gov-in-a-Box effort, technical experts from India and the United States share respective best practices, ideas and experiences to create an open-source, integrated version of Data.gov that will provide citizens with open government data and public information in a usable format. Data.gov-in-a-Box will provide an integrated, open-source platform, free of charge and intellectual property constraints that any government can use. Also, this effort will issue challenges and other citizen engagement initiatives to encourage citizens of both countries to develop new applications for global use. We plan to make Data.gov-in-a-Box available by early 2012.</span></p></li><li><p><span></span><span> Launched a new Interactive Catalog, a cloud-based capability that provides a better interface to help citizens find and use the data they are looking for. It is based on a modular, cloud-based platform architecture, so it is available anywhere, anytime, is secure and backed-up, without the expense of dedicated government servers. All agencies can load their data, getting easy access to the cloud and allowing smaller agencies to host large amounts of data at a reasonable cost. Application developers will be able to access the data in real-time (versus downloading files) through open, consistent, ubiquitous, standards-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), enabling them to tailor applications to use only the data they need (promoting mobile apps), and enabling real-time updates for always-fresh data. The new platform also makes it easy to embed data from Data.Gov on blogs, websites and social media pages.</span></p></li></ul></root>
