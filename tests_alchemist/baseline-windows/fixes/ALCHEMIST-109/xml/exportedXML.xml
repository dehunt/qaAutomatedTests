The answer to that question is “yes.” The Committee’s contrary position would give</span></p><p><span>Congress unfettered access to all Executive information other than presidential communications, in contravention of both the constitutional separation of powers and well over two centuries of dealings between the Legislative and Executive Branches.</span></p><p><span>Congress has an unquestioned ability to obtain information from the Executive Branch and other sources in aid of its legislative function.

The need for an Executive sphere of confidentiality is particularly strong in the present context, which involves a congressional demand for information that would reveal the process by which the Executive responds to congressional inquiries. The absence of confidentiality in these circumstances would impair</span></p><p><span>Executive officials’ ability to perform their constitutional functions, which include responding</span></p><p><span>independently and effectively to requests for information and participating in the negotiation and accommodation process that is an integral part of the constitutional framework and separation of</span></p><p><span>powers.</span><span style="italic+underline"><a href="http://Additional%20Inputs/cs%20United%20States%20v.%20AT&amp;T%20Co.,%20567%20F.2d%20121.pdf#567f2d130"> United States v.
