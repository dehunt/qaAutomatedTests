The SICAV is an umbrella investment company with variable capital having segregated liability between its sub-funds (the “Funds”). Authorisation by the CSSF does not imply approval by any Luxembourg authority of the contents of this Prospectus or of any portfolio of securities held by the Funds. Any representation to the contrary is unauthorised and unlawful. In particular, authorisation of the SICAV and the Funds by the CSSF does not constitute a warranty as to the performance of the Funds and the CSSF shall not be liable for the performance or default of the SICAV and the Funds.</span></p><p><span>A Key Investor Information Document (“KIID”) is available for each launched Share class of the Funds. In addition to summarising important information in this Prospectus, the KIID shall contain information on the historical performance for each Share class of the Funds. The KIID is a pre-contractual document, which shall provide information on the risk profile of the relevant Fund, including appropriate guidance and warnings in relation to the risks associated with investment in the Fund and includes a synthetic risk and reward indicator in the form of a numerical scale, which ranks risks associated with investment on a scale of one to seven. Please note that in accordance with the UCITS Directive if you are an investor, who invests directly in the SICAV in your own name and behalf, you must be in receipt of the most up-to-date version of the relevant KIID before placing your subscription and/or switch of Shares; otherwise, the relevant transaction may be delayed or rejected. The English versions of the KIID shall be available on the website of the Management Company (</span><span><a href="http://www.invescomanagementcompany.lu">www.invescomanagementcompany.lu</a></span><span>) and where relevant, translations of the KIID shall be available on the Invesco Local Websites, accessible through</span><span><a href="http://www.invesco.com"> www.invesco.com</a></span><span>. The KIID can also be obtained at the registered office of the Management Company.</span></p><p><span>Statements made in this Prospectus are, except where otherwise stated, based on the law and practice currently in force in Luxembourg and are subject to changes therein. The delivery of this Prospectus (whether or not accompanied by any Reports) or the issue of Shares shall not, under any circumstances, create any implication that the affairs of the SICAV and the Funds have not changed since the date hereof.</span></p><p><span>No person has been authorised to give any information or to make any representations in connection with the offering of Shares other than those contained in this Prospectus and the Reports, and, if given or made, such information or representations must not be relied on as having been authorised by the SICAV.</span></p><p><span>The distribution of this Prospectus and the offering of Shares in certain jurisdictions may be restricted. Persons into whose possession this Prospectus comes should inform themselves of and observe any such restrictions. This Prospectus does not constitute an offer or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is not authorised or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation.</span></p><p><span>The SICAV draws the attention of the investors to the fact that any investor will only be able to fully exercise his/her investor rights directly against the SICAV, notably the right to participate in general meeting of Shareholders if the investor is registered himself/herself and in his/her own name in the register of Shareholders. In cases where an investor invests in the SICAV through an intermediary investing into the SICAV in his/her own name but on behalf of the investor, it may not always be possible</span> <span>for the investor to exercise certain Shareholder rights. Investors are advised to take advice on their rights.</span></p><p><span>Shareholders and potential investors (and intermediaries acting for potential investors) should refer also to Section 5.2.4 (Restrictions on ownership of Shares) for further details about the general definition of ‘Prohibited Persons’ and Section 5.4.3 (Compulsory redemptions) for further details about compulsory redemptions.</span></p><p><span>This Prospectus may be translated into other languages.</span></p><p><span>In such cases, the translation shall be as close as possible to a direct translation from the English text and any changes therefrom shall be only as necessary to comply with the requirements of the regulatory authorities of other jurisdictions. In the event of any inconsistency or ambiguity in relation to the meaning of any word or phrase in any translation, the English text shall prevail to the extent permitted by the applicable laws or regulations, and all disputes as to the terms thereof shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Luxembourg.</span></p><p><span>The investment objective and policy of each Fund is set out in Appendix A.</span></p><p><span>Investment in the Funds should be regarded as a medium to long-term investment (for further details, please refer to Appendix A). There can be no guarantee that the objectives of the Funds will be achieved.</span></p><p><span>The Funds’ investments are subject to normal market fluctuations and the risks inherent in all investments and there can be no assurances that appreciation will occur. It will be the policy of the SICAV to maintain a diversified portfolio of investments so as to minimise risk.</span></p><p><span>The SICAV may, at its discretion, alter investment objective and policy provided that any material change in investment objective and policy is notified to Shareholders at least one month prior to its effective date and this Prospectus is updated accordingly.</span></p><p><span>The investments of a Fund may be denominated in currencies other than the base currency of that Fund. The value of those investments (when converted to the base currency of that Fund) may fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. The value of Shares and the income from them may fall as well as rise and investors may not realise their initial investment.</span></p><p><span>Attention is drawn to Section 8 (Risk Warnings).</span></p><p><span>All capitalised terms used in this Prospectus shall have the meanings given to them in Section 2 (Definitions) unless the context requires otherwise.</span></p><p><span>Potential investors should seek independent professional advice as to (a) the possible tax consequences, (b) the legal requirements and (c) any foreign exchange restrictions or exchange control requirements which they might encounter under the laws of the countries of their citizenship, residence or domicile and which might be relevant to the subscription, purchase, holding, switching and disposal of Shares.</span></p><p><span>Investors should note that certain Funds may be authorised for distribution to the public in their country. Please see Invesco Local Websites and/or contact your local Invesco office to verify which Funds are authorised for distribution to the public in your country.</span></p><anchors id="page3"></anchors><p><span style="bold">1 Important Information</span><span> Continued</span></p><p><span>Certain important information on specific countries is set out in the relevant country supplement distributed together with this Prospectus, as required by the relevant local laws.</span></p><p><span>Shares may not be held by any person in breach of the law or requirements of any country or governmental authority including, without limitation, exchange control regulations. Each investor must represent and warrant to the SICAV that, amongst other things, he is able to acquire Shares without violating applicable laws. Power is reserved in the Articles to reject subscriptions for any reason or to compulsorily redeem any Shares held directly or beneficially in contravention of these prohibitions.</span></p><p><span>The SICAV is subject to investment supervision as defined in the German Investment Tax Act. The business objective of each Fund is limited to the investment and administration of that Fund’s assets for the joint account of the investors, and none of the Funds engage in an active entrepreneurial management of assets in the context of the German Investment Tax Act.</span></p><p><span>Any person to whom an interest is issued or sold must not, within 12 months after the issue, offer, transfer or assign that interest to investors in Australia except in circumstances where disclosure to investors is not required under the Corporations Act.</span></p><p><span style="bold">Important Information for New Zealand residents</span><span> The provision of this Prospectus to any person does not constitute an offer of financial products for issue or sale in, or to any person in, New Zealand for the purposes of the New Zealand Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (</span><span>NZ Act</span><span>) and, accordingly, there is neither a product disclosure statement (PDS) nor any other register entry information available in respect of the offer (and, to avoid doubt, this document is neither a registered PDS nor any type of entry information for the purposes of the NZ Act).</span></p><p><span>No person may:</span></p><p><span></span><span> offer, sell or deliver any Shares, or distribute any documents relating to the Shares (including this</span></p><p><span style="bold">Important Information for US Persons</span></p><p><span>None of the Shares have been or will be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), or registered or qualified under applicable state statutes, and none of the Shares may be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, in the United States of America or in any of its territories or possessions (the “United States”) or to any US Person (as defined herein). The SICAV has not been and will not be registered under the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), and investors will not be entitled to the benefits and protections of the 1940 Act. Shareholders are also required to notify the Registrar and Transfer Agent and/or the Data Processing Agent immediately in the event that they become a US Person and the Registrar and Transfer Agent and/or the Data Processing Agent may, at its discretion, redeem or otherwise dispose of the Shares by transferring them to a person who is not a US Person. Investors are directed to the definition of “US Persons” in Section 2 (Definitions).</span></p><p><span>The SICAV will not knowingly offer or sell Shares to any investor to whom such offer or sale would be unlawful, or might result in the SICAV incurring any liability to taxation or suffering any other pecuniary disadvantages which the SICAV might not otherwise incur or suffer or would result in the SICAV being required to register under the 1940 Act or under the Commodities Exchange Act.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>document), to any person within New Zealand; or apply for Shares from New Zealand.</span></p><p><span>The foregoing does not preclude the SICAV from electing to offer, in the SICAV’s sole discretion, Shares to certain persons or types of persons in New Zealand from time to time.</span></p><p><span style="bold">Important Information for Canadian residents</span></p><p><span>The Shares in the Funds which are described in this Prospectus have not been and will not be registered for distribution in Canada and may not be directly or indirectly offered or sold in Canada to or for the account or benefit of any resident of Canada, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of Canada and/or its provinces and where the resident of Canada is able to demonstrate and certify that they are able to purchase the relevant Fund and are “accredited investors”.</span></p><p><span style="bold">Important Information for Australian residents</span></p><p><span>The provision of this Prospectus to any person does not constitute an offer of an interest to that person or an invitation to apply for an interest.
